# Gravitational-Clustering---Big-Data-Application-Required
The proposed algorithm primarily draws inspiration from the physical laws of interaction such as Coulomb’s law and Newton’s law, and from the clustering algorithms DBSCAN and other forms of density-based clustering or attraction-based clustering and Jarvis-Patrick Clustering.
